          know about their colleagues easily. To counter this, run a short get
          to know you session. Get team members to share things like: working
          hours, city they live in, time zone, contact info. If people are open,
          share some personal details such as hobbies, family status, favorite
          food and beverage. Some teams even create a wiki or site to share this
          information.

            The Development Team and the Product Owner sit down every Sprint.
            They take the time to better understand upcoming features. They
            might estimate or split stories, create acceptance criteria. They
            also create new stories and delete ones that no longer make sense.
            All of this improves their understanding of the product they're
            building.
